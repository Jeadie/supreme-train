# Assignment 1
This is a simple client-server socket program. Written in python, no compilation or
non-standard dependencies are required. Socket programming and server-client designed
was influenced by the following text/s:
  * "Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, 7th Edition" by James Kurose and Keith Ross

## Usage

To run the Server:
```
  sh server.sh <req_code>
```

To run the Client:
```
  sh client.sh <server_addr> <port> <req_code> <message>
```
where:
  * req_code: the server request code to ensure only intended clients are connecting.
  * server_addr: the address of the server, for the client to connect to.
  * port: The port of the server for clients to connect to request a UDP port. Note,
      this is dynamically generated by the server at runtime.
  * message: The message for the client to send to the server. If the server receives
   the message, "TERMINATE", the server will terminate.
